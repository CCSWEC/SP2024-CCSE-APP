# SP2024-CCSE-APP
App repo for ccse spring 2024 app project



You will be creating an app!
The nature of the app is up to the group to deccide but the app must have the ability to read and write data from a database (would reccoment Sqlite)
here is a tut i found really helpful when using sqlite -> https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSrm9z4zp4mGK0g_0_jxYGgg3os9tqRUQ&si=hPkaxw3Ef_c6Q8_5

Default IDE will be android studio but if entire group agrees to switch to a different one then that is allowed!

Challenge (does not need to be implemented):
  1. Add in at least one third party API (make sure its free) so if you're building a wellness app, integrate it with an API relating to health that displays information from the website (mayoclinic, healthline, etc)
